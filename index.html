				<b>Why you need to start learning by yourself..</b>
			</div>

			<div class="desc-text">
				To teach yourself you will need to learn hands on. You will need to do some research where you learn what is possible and procedures and where you get ideas, but don't forget the hands on side of it. It's one thing to know what would happen if you were to do something, but it's something else entirely to know because you actually did it. <br><br>

				The next thing to remember is to start small. Learn about simple home wiring before you try to set up a generator to a windmill to power your home. Learn how to change the oil before you decide to replace the transmission. <br><br>

				This is why we created this site, to help you learn, by reviewing your work, motivating and helping you along the way! :D
